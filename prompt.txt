HTML fragment below is from nexusmods.com mod description.
However, the resulting fragment didn't follow the correct semantic
of HTML (such as proper heading usage) and instead most of the time 
mimicking HTML heading, etc. with style, BBCode, there are even some
mod page that uses image as heading instead.

Your task:
- Convert this fragment to markdown
- Wrap all references/mention to other mod with format `[[{mod_name}]]`
- To be noted that mention/reference to other mod name can be in form of abbreviation of said mod.
  For example, YASTM or SOS.
- In case the reference/mention to other mod is also wrapped with link or has link in adjacent DOM node/text, change it to format:
  `[[{mod_name}]]\({mod_url})`
- Continuing from point before, in case a link is found and it points to github, nexusmods.com, or other mod site, it is most likely a mod so
  same rule from point before is applied to it
- In case an image is used as heading, create a separate proper heading and keep the image intact
- Convert all unhandled BBCode to their markdown counterpart
- In case a link or image is found inside a div, use HTML tag instead of markdown 
- Use heading starting from H2

And here is the fragment:
