HTML fragment below is from nexusmods.com mod description.
However, the resulting fragment didn't follow the correct semantic
of HTML (such as proper heading usage) and instead most of the time 
mimicking HTML heading, etc. with style, BBCode, there are even some
mod page that uses image as heading instead.

Your task:
- Convert this fragment to markdown
- You MUST wrap all references/mention to other mod with format `[[{mod_name}]]`, whether or not it has backlink url or not.
  - Mention/reference to other mod name may also be in form of abbreviation of said mod. If in doubt, just wrap it.
  - Look out for Compatibility, Incompatibility, or Requirement section in the mod page since it will be highly likely that
    many mods will be mentioned here. 
  - In case the reference/mention to other mod is also wrapped with link or has link in adjacent DOM node/text, change it to format:
    `[[{mod_name}]]\({mod_url})`.
  - Any wrapped mod name MUST NOT be be wrapped with HTML tag since it will break markdown parsing
  - In case a link is found and it points to github, nexusmods.com, or other mod site, it is most likely a mod so also wrap it.
- In case an image is used as heading, create a separate proper heading and keep the image intact
- Convert all unhandled BBCode to their markdown counterpart
- In case a link or image is found inside a div, use HTML tag instead of markdown 
- Use heading starting from H2

And here is the fragment:
