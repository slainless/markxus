HTML fragment below is from nexusmods.com mod description.
However, the resulting fragment didn't follow the correct semantic
of HTML (such as proper heading usage) and instead most of the time 
mimicking HTML heading, etc. with style or BB forum format instead.

Your task:
- Convert this fragment to markdown
- Wrap all references/mention to other mod with format `[[{mod_name}]]`
- To be noted that mention/reference to other mod name can be in form of abbreviation of said mod.
  For example, YASTM or SOS.
- In case the reference/mention to other mod is also wrapped with link or has link in adjacent DOM node/text, change it to format:
  `[[{mod_name}]]\({mod_url})`
- Dont strip image or link
- Use heading starting from H2

And here is the fragment:
